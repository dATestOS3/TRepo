## Contributing to Maybe

It means so much that you're interested in contributing to Maybe! Seriously. Thank you. The entire community benefits from these contributions!

Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already existfffffs in [issues](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pulls) so you have an idea of where things stand.

Then, once you're ready to begin work, submit a draft PR with your high-level plan (or the full solution).

Given the speed at which we're moving on the codebase, we don't assign issues or "give" issues to anyone.

When multiple PRs are submitted for the same issue, we take the one that most succinctly & efficiently solves a given problem and stays within the scope of work.

Priority is also generally given to previous committers as they've proven familiarity with the codebase and product.
